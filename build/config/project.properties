# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties

# Explanation: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values.
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatenated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property
# These files are concatenated in addition to the default set in the default properties file (i.e. style.css).
file.stylesheets  = test_master.css


# Web Pages
#
# These are the pages (files) that will be served to users (.html, .php, .asp, etc). Files in this property will
# be minified / optimised and have any stylesheet or javascript references updated to the minified examples
#
# The paths need to be relative
#
# Files can be added in a comma separated form

# Excluded files and dirs

# Add any files or directories you add to the project and do not want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files are ignored in addition to the default ones specified in default.properties.
